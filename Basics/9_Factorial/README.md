# Factorial

A simple program that computes the factorial of an input number.

# Algorithm

1. Start the program.
2. Ask the user to enter a non-negative integer.
3. Read the integer from the user and store it in a variable `n`.
4. Initialize a variable `factorial` to 1.
5. If `n` is 0 or 1, set `factorial` to 1.
6. Otherwise, use a loop to iterate from `n` down to 1.
7. Multiply `factorial` by the current iteration variable.
8. When the loop is finished, `factorial` will contain the factorial of `n`.
9. Print the value of `factorial`.
10. End the program.
